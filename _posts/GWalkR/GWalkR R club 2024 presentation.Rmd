## GwalkR is a Tableau-like package that allows you to visualize and compare data without the need for ggplot and long code paragraphs.
## Plus it's free!

# It is simple and only requires 2 lines of code. Though, you do need to process and preformat any data you would like to use. This package allows you to visualize data and export graphs.

## If you would like further information, you can visit the GitHub page https://github.com/Kanaries/GWalkR
